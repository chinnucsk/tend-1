Changelog
=========

0.2.0
-----
- Adding support for `file://` protocol in files to look up. The protocol only
supports locahost (`file:///...` or `file://localhost/...`), and does not support
the old windows format that uses `c|` instead of `c:`.

0.1.0
-----
Initial version, somewhat badly tagged in OTP files to be using version 0.0.1
